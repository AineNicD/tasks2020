# tasks2020
My GMIT Fundamentals of Data Analysis tasks

## Introduction
This repository contains four tasks in a single jupyter notebook given in the Fundementals of Data Analysis module in Gmit HDip data analytics. 

### [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
-is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It is best installed with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). 
Anaconda simplifies package management and deployment by having the most popular python packages installed on your machine even before you know you will be using them. 
Jupyter can also be installed separately from its website.

### Launching Jupyter Notebook App
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu or by typing 'Jupyter Notebook' in a terminal.
### How do run/save this jupyter notebook
- First click on Raw.
- Then, press ctrl+s to save it as tasks2020.ipynb (files from GitHub are saved as text files as default, so you'll have to manually type '. ipynb' after the file name to make this work.)
- Open CMDER and type in Jupyter Notebook
- Jupyter notebook should appear in your browser 
- Go to the file location where you saved the tasks2020.ipynb
- Open file.

## Task 1 : October 5th, 2020:
~~~ 
"Write a Python function called counts that takes a list as
input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of
times each item appears as values. So, the input ['A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A']
should have output {'A': 3, 'B': 1, 'C': 1} . Your code should not depend
on any module from the standard library or otherwise. You should research the task
first and include a description with references of your algorithm in the notebook."

## Task 2: November 2nd, 2020:
~~~
Write a Python function called dicerolls that simulates
rolling dice. Your function should take two parameters: the number of dice k and
the number of times to roll the dice n. The function should simulate randomly
rolling k dice n times, keeping track of each total face value. It should then return
a dictionary with the number of times each possible total face value occurred. So,
calling the function as diceroll(k=2, n=1000) should return a dictionary like:
{2:19,3:50,4:82,5:112,6:135,7:174,8:133,9:114,10:75,11:70,12:36}
