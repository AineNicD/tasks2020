My GMIT Fundamentals of Data Analysis tasks

## Introduction
This repository contains four tasks in a single jupyter notebook given in the Fundementals of Data Analysis module in Gmit HDip data analytics. 

## Task 1 : October 5th, 2020:

~~~ 
"Write a Python function called counts that takes a list as
input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of
times each item appears as values. So, the input ['A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A']
should have output {'A': 3, 'B': 1, 'C': 1} . Your code should not depend
on any module from the standard library or otherwise. You should research the task
first and include a description with references of your algorithm in the notebook."

## Technologies 

* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a free source-code editor which is great for editing and working on code. 

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), a free and open-source distribution of the Python programming language.
Anaconda is popular because it brings many of the tools used in data science and machine learning with just one install, so it's great for having short and simple setup. It has all the libraries needed to write and implement the programs in these tasks.
